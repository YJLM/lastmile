         - "Last Mile is a project focused on visualizing information relevant to logistic operations in different contexts, collecting and displaying urban and corporate information. Last Mile is composed of two different platforms: km2 and loopa."
         - "The goal of km2 is to characterize areas of some of the worldâ€™s major megacities and observe their dynamics and conditions to obtain valuable information about factors that have influence over urban logistics performance. This is done using system designed for this purpose that allows easy visualization of the data. "
         - "Loopa is a tool that allows the user to map and observe the operations of a distribution network of a company. The tool allows the easy visualization of data and provides analytical insight that enables the observer to understand the behavior of the customers and the demand in the specified region. "
